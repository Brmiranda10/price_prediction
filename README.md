So, guess what? I dabbled with PySpark to take a shot at predicting house prices. Yeah, I know, it sounds all fancy and stuff. I threw in a bunch of different things like how big the place is, how many bedrooms it’s got, and all sorts of other factors.

I tried out three different techniques: logistic regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression.

So there you have it – PySpark and a bunch of fancy models cooking up some pretty accurate house price predictions. And that random forest one? It's like the MVP, giving you the scoop on house prices with its secret formula.
